## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.
4. Use the buttons to perform calculations.

## Implementation Details

- **Buttons**: Different buttons represent numbers, arithmetic operators, and other functionalities. These buttons are laid out using Stack Views to maintain a consistent spacing and alignment across various screen sizes.

- **Auto Layout**: Constraints are applied to ensure that the UI elements adjust appropriately on different iOS devices and orientations.

- **Stack Views**: Stack Views are used to group and organize the buttons. This simplifies the layout structure and makes it easier to manage the arrangement of elements.

- **Calculator Logic**: The app logic handles the calculations based on user input. It processes the input sequence to perform arithmetic operations and display the result accurately.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex operations such as exponentiation, square root, etc.
- History feature to keep track of previous calculations.
- Improved UI design with themes and customization options.
